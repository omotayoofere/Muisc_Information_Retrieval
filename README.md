# Music Information Retrieval
The massive consumption of audio and video contents in this era across multiple media for streaming has necessitated the improvement of information retrieval processes. An automated rather than a manual approach highly necessary to improves users’ experience in accessing contents in a massive content library. 

Music classification, a technique that enhances users’ music experience through recommendation, curation, and analysis of listening behavior.
- Recommendation: Once musical attributes have labeled a system can recommend music to users based on frequently consumed musical attributes of the users. 
- Curation: Music curation replaces human’s manual effort in browsing enormous music libraries efficiently. 
- Listening behavior analysis: Most modern streaming services provide annual reports of personal listening trends for generic view as to what genre/form of music caught most attention

The motivation behind this study is to achieve a better score for the accuracy metric in the classification of music data by exploring handful for machine learning models. For a given song, the music classifier predicts its genre based on relevant musical attributes
